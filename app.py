            ### What it does?

            It extracts the key points from the long and never read terms and conditions documents.
            ### Built with

            - [AI21 Labs](https://www.ai21.com/)
            - [Courier](https://www.courier.com/)
            - [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)

            ### How it works?
            Initially it segments the texts from the given document URL and send it to AI21 Labs to extract the key points in chunks and ties it up. 
            Then it uses Courier API to send the result to the desired E-Mail given by the user.
