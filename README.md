# TnC-Digest
Know what the Terms and Conditions say!

### Inspiration
The inspiration behind TnC Digest was to help people understand lengthy terms and conditions documents, which are often difficult to read and understand. 
To be honest, I have never read a single Terms and Conditions or Policy documents in a my life before signing up any product/service. Have you?

### What it does?
TnC Digest is an app that uses AI to summarize terms, conditions, and policies documents into key points and highlights the most important information for the user and sends the email.

### How I built it
It is build with Python and the AI21 API. I also used Streamlit for the user interface and Courier API to send emails.

### Future Scope
I think go to another app is not that good. It is better if we have a **Chrome Extension**. When a user click on the extension it automatically generates key points and also sends those to the respective user to know what they are signing up for.
